# Doric
Doric is a high-performance framework for cross-platform development. With TSX or TypeScript, a set of code can perform consistently across different platforms.

## Feature
### Cross-platform consistency
Doric supports Android, iOS, Qt & Web, implements 'write once, run anywhere, perform consistently' across different platforms.
### High-performance rendering
Doric adopts native components or widgets on rendering views, provides a set of APIs under native standard. Doric architecture has multiple inner mechanism for efficient communication between 'Native' & 'JS', such as dirty-value detection、local-update on views, thus Doric pages will rival native pages on performance when rendering.
### Light-weight & Easy-extensible
Doric SDK follows fundamental principles, its core provides universal views, components and native modules, which can properly satisfy most scenarios.
Moreover, Doric provides an integral mechanism for plugin development, you can register your libraries or plugins with Doric API to provide view components or other native abilities.
### Easy to get started with sufficient toolchains
Doric includes a scaffolding tool `doric-cli` and a debug tool `Devkit`, offering multiple tools, such as hot-reload、breakpoint debugging、waterfall-like performance profile、tree nodes viewer and so on, aiming at assisting developers building user interfaces, analyzing and debugging efficiently.
